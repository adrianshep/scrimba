// Modern JavaScript Development

// code used to be written in one or a few big scripts, which would then be sent to a browser
// currently, we divide our projects into multiple modules that can share data between themselves
// this makes our code more organized and maintainable
// a great thing about modules is that we can also inclue third party modules in our code
// there are thousands of open source modules which we call packages that developers share on the NPM repository
// we can use these packages for free in our own code
// for example, the React framework or jQuery, or even the Leaflet library that we used in our Mapty project
// NPM stands for Node Package Manager, originally developed together with and for Node.js
// however, NPM has established itself as the go-to depository for all kinds of packages in modern JS development
// in order to download, use and share packages, we use NPM software installed on our computer
// it's a simple command line interface allowing us to do all that
// NPM is both a repository in which packages live and a program we use on our computers to install and manage these packages
