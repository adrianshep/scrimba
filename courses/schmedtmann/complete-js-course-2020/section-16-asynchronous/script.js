'use strict';

const btn = document.querySelector('.btn-country');
const countriesContainer = document.querySelector('.countries');

// Synchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
alert('Text set!');
p.style.color = 'red';

// most code is synchronous
// executed line by line in exact order we defined in our code
// each line of code always waits for previous line to finish execution
// this can create problems:
// in example, alert statement will block the rest of the code executing until OK button is clicked
// most of time, synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense


// Asynchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
setTimeout(function() {
    p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
}, 5000);
p.style.color = 'red';

// here, the timer runs in the background
// does not prevent the main code from executing
// the callback function is asynchronous JS
// it will not be executed immediately, but only after the timer has finished running in the background -- asynchronously
// it's non-blocking -- the rest of the code can keep running normally
// in summary, asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time


// Callback Functions

// in the above example, we need a callback function to implement the asynchronous behavior
// however, that doesn't mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous
// for example, the Array map method accepts a callback function, but that doesn't make that code asynchronous
