// Synchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
alert('Text set!');
p.style.color = 'red';

// most code is synchronous
// executed line by line in exact order we defined in our code
// each line of code always waits for previous line to finish execution
// this can create problems:
// in example, alert statement will block the rest of the code executing until OK button is clicked
// most of time, synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense


// Asynchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
setTimeout(function() {
    p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
}, 5000);
p.style.color = 'red';

// here, the timer runs in the background
// does not prevent the main code from executing
// the callback function is asynchronous JS
// it will not be executed immediately, but only after the timer has finished running in the background -- asynchronously
// it's non-blocking -- the rest of the code can keep running normally
// in summary, asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time


// Callback Functions

// in the above example, we need a callback function to implement the asynchronous behavior
// however, that doesn't mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous
// for example, the Array map method accepts a callback function, but that doesn't make that code asynchronous


// Asynchronous Example

const img = document.querySelector('.dog');
img.src = 'dog.jpg';
img.addEventListener('load', function() {
    img.classList.add('fadeIn';)
});
p.style.width = '300px';

// this example is about loading an image
// first two lines run in a synchronous way, one after the other
// in the second line, we set the source attribute of the image we selected in the first line
// this operation is asynchronous -- setting the source attribute of any image is essentially loading an image in the background while the rest of the code keeps running
// if it is a huge image, we wouldn't want the entire code to wait for it to load
// once the image has finished loading, a load event will automatically be emitted by JS
// we can listen for that event in order to act upon it
// in the code, we use add event listener and provide a callback function that will be executed once the image has been loaded
// all this code is non-blocking -- execution moves on right to the next line immediately
// the callback function is finally executed when the image is completely loaded and the load event is admitted
// event listeners alone do not make code asynchronous
// an event listener listening for a click on a button is not doing any work in the background
// waiting for a click is not doing anything
// so there is no asynchronous behavior involved at all



// What Are Ajax Calls?

// AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
// allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way
// with AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically, without reloading the page
// for example, right in the next video, we're going to make Ajax calls to request data about countries
// we can then use that data to build a small application that shows us information about the country we're in

// let's say we have JS application running in the browser, which is called the client
// we want this application to get some countries data from a web server
// we send an HTTP request to the server
// the server will then send back a response containing the data we requested
// the back and forth between the client and the server happens asynchronously, in the background

// when we ask a server to send us data, the server usually contains a web API
// API = Application Programming Interface
// An API is basically software that can be used by other software to allow applications to talk to one another and exchange information
// countless types: DOM API or Geolocation API
// called APIs because they are self-contained, encapsulated software that allow other software to interact with them
// we can implement a small and simple API in a class where we make some methods available as a public interface

// "Online" API
// others refer to these as web APIs, or simply APIs
// Jonas uses "Online" API since Web API can refer to other things
// an application running on a web server which receives requests for data, then retrieves this data from some database and sends it back as a response

// 3rd Party APIs
// we're interested in 3rd party APIs, APIs that other developers make available to us most of the time for free
// imagine we're building a travel application and have a database with different destinations and tours we're offering
// we could build our own API to receive requests fomr our front end application in JS and send back the results
// that would be our own API hosted on our own server
// alone, though, that probably wouldn't be enough to build a complete application
// we could then use some 3rd party APIs:
// get data about weather at destinations, the destinations themselves, flights, currency conversion, etc.
// can even use these APIs to send emails or texts or embed Google Maps into our application
// APIs make the modern web as we know it possible

// API Data Formats
// X in AJAX is for XML, a data format that used to be widely used, but no API uses it anymore
// most APIs use JSON format these days
// it's basically just a JavaScript object, but converted to a string
// therefore, it's very easy to send across the web and also to use in JavaScript once the data arrives

'use strict';

const btn = document.querySelector('.btn-country');
const countriesContainer = document.querySelector('.countries');

// in JS, there are multiple ways of doing AJAX calls:


// XML HTTP Request
// First Step:
// we call this function then store the result in a new variable

const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', '');
