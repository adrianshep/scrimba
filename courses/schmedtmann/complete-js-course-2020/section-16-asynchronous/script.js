///////////////////////////////////////

// Synchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
alert('Text set!');
p.style.color = 'red';

// most code is synchronous
// executed line by line in exact order we defined in our code
// each line of code always waits for previous line to finish execution
// this can create problems:
// in example, alert statement will block the rest of the code executing until OK button is clicked
// most of time, synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense
// for example, however, imagine execution waiting for a five second timer to finish
// nothing on the page would work during those five seconds


// Asynchronous Code

const p = document.querySelector('.p');
setTimeout(function() {
    p.textContent = 'My name is Jonas!';
}, 5000);
p.style.color = 'red';

// here, the timer runs in the background
// does not prevent the main code from executing
// the callback function is asynchronous JS
// it will not be executed immediately, but only after the timer has finished running in the background -- asynchronously
// it's non-blocking -- the rest of the code can keep running normally
// in summary, asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time


// Callback Functions

// in the above example, we need a callback function to implement the asynchronous behavior
// however, that doesn't mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous
// for example, the Array map method accepts a callback function, but that doesn't make that code asynchronous


// Asynchronous Example

const img = document.querySelector('.dog');
img.src = 'dog.jpg';
img.addEventListener('load', function() {
    img.classList.add('fadeIn';)
});
p.style.width = '300px';

// this example is about loading an image
// first two lines run in a synchronous way, one after the other
// in the second line, we set the source attribute of the image we selected in the first line
// this operation is asynchronous -- setting the source attribute of any image is essentially loading an image in the background while the rest of the code keeps running
// if it is a huge image, we wouldn't want the entire code to wait for it to load
// once the image has finished loading, a load event will automatically be emitted by JS
// we can listen for that event in order to act upon it
// in the code, we use add event listener and provide a callback function that will be executed once the image has been loaded
// all this code is non-blocking -- execution moves on right to the next line immediately
// the callback function is finally executed when the image is completely loaded and the load event is admitted
// event listeners alone do not make code asynchronous
// an event listener listening for a click on a button is not doing any work in the background
// waiting for a click is not doing anything
// so there is no asynchronous behavior involved at all


// AJAX

// let's say we have JS application running in the browser, which is called the client
// we want this application to get some countries data from a web server
// we send an HTTP request to the server
// the server will then send back a response containing the data we requested
// the back and forth between the client and the server happens asynchronously, in the background
// when we ask a server to send us data, the server usually contains a web API
// API = Application Programming Interface
// An API is basically software that can be used by other software to allow applications to talk to one another and exchange information
// countless types: DOM API or Geolocation API
// called APIs because they are self-contained, encapsulated software that allow other software to interact with them
// we can implement a small and simple API in a class where we make some methods available as a public interface

// we're interested in 3rd party APIs, APIs that other developers make available to us most of the time for free
// imagine we're building a travel application and have a database with different destinations and tours we're offering
// we could build our own API to receive requests fomr our front end application in JS and send back the results
// that would be our own API hosted on our own server
// alone, though, that probably wouldn't be enough to build a complete application
// we could then use some 3rd party APIs:
// get data about weather at destinations, the destinations themselves, flights, currency conversion, etc.
// can even use these APIs to send emails or texts or embed Google Maps into our application
// APIs make the modern web as we know it possible

// in JS, there are multiple ways of doing AJAX calls:

// XML HTTP Request
// First Step:
// we call this function then store the result in a new variable

// create request element for multiple countries
const getCountryData = function (country) {
    // create request
    const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // open request
    request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`);
    // send request to above URL (endpoint)
    request.send();
// in order to get the result, we can't do something like:
// data = request.send();
// because the result simply isn't there yet
// the AJAX call that we send off is being executed in the background while the rest of the code keeps running
// this is the asychronous, non-blocking behavior
    // instead, we need to register a callback on the request object for the load event
    request.addEventListener('load', function() {
        console.log(this.responseText);
        const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);

    const renderCountry = function(data, className = '') {
        const html = `
        <article class="country ${className}">
            <img class="country__img" src="${data.flag}" />
            <div class="country__data">
                <h3 class="country__name">${data.name}</h3>
                <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
                <p class="country__row"><span>üë´</span>${(+data.population / 1000000).toFixed(1)} people</p>
                <p class="country__row"><span>üó£Ô∏è</span>${data.languages[0].name}</p>
                <p class="country__row"><span>üí∞</span>${data.currencies[0].name}</p>
            </div>
        </article>
        `;
        countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
        // countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
    });
};

// on the request, we will wait for the load event
// in the background, that request fetches the data
// once it is done, it will emit the load event
// using this event listener, we are waiting for that event
// as soon as the data arrives, this callback function here will be called
// this.responseText logs all the data there is about Portugal at the endpoint returned in JSON format -- a long string of text
// JSON.parse converts that string into an object
// actually an array containing one object
// destructure const data by converting it to const [data]
// same as doing:
// const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)[0];
// build card component const html
// replace the data in the component -- flag, name, region, population, name, currency -- drawing from the API
// under population, convert data to number by placing + in front of it
// insert HTML using countriesContainer
// set style of container to opacity one which will generate an animation triggered by the transition
// test multiple country request element:
getCountryData('portugal');
getCountryData('usa');
// data requests for Portugal and USA happen nearly simultaneously
// data for them is returned asynchronously
// USA data may appear before Portugal data
// non-blocking behavior in action


// on GitHub there is a huge Public APIs repository (you can Google it) that are free to use
// we'll be using REST Countries
// needs no authentication
// any API you use should always have CORS set to yes or maybe to unknown
// CORS stands for Cross Origin Resources Sharing
// without CORS, we cannot access a third party API from our own code

// endpoint (the url we'll be using):
// https://restcountries.com/v2/name/portugal


// Request-Response Model or Client-Server Architecture
// whenever we try to access a Web server, the browser, which is the client, sends a request to the server and the server will then send back a response that contains the data or Web page we requested
// this process works the exact same way, no matter if we're accessing an entire Web page or just some data from a Web API
// https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/PT
// http or https is the protocol to be used on this connection
// /rest/v2... is the resource that we want to access
// restcountries.eu is the domain name
// not the real address of the server we're trying to access
// just a name that's easy for us to memorize
// this means we need a way of converting the domain name to the real address of the server
// that happens through DNS -- the domain name server
// like the phone book of the internet: will match the web address of the URL to the server's real IP address -- this happens through your internet service provider
// when the real IP address has been sent back to our browser, we can finally call it
// what the real IP address looks like:
// https://104.27.142.889:443
// protocol is https
// IP address is 104.27.142.889
// port number is 443 (default for HTTPs and HTTP) -- the port we access on the server identifying a specific service running on it, like a sub-address
// nothing to do with the /rest/v2 resource we want to access

// once we have the real IP address, a TCP socket connection is established between the browser and the server and they are now finally connected
// this connection will typically be kept alive the entire time it takes to transfer all the request files of the website or the data
// TCP is Transmission Control Protocol
// IP is Internet Protocol
// they are communication protocols that define exactly how data travels across the web -- the internet's fundamental control system, setting the rules for how data moves around the internet

// making our HTTP request
// HyperText Transfer Protocol
// a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more parties to communicate
// HTTP is a protocol that allows clients and web servers to communicate by sending request and response messages from client to server and back
// request message format:

//  GET /rest/v2/alpha/PT HTTP/1.1
//  Host: www.google.com
//  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
//  Accept-Language: en-US
// 
//  <BODY>

// beginning of the message is the most important part, called the start line
// it contains the HTTP method that is used in the request, the request target and the HTTP version
// there many available HTTP methods
// most important ones are:
// GET for simply requesting data
// POST for sending data
// PUT and PATCH for modifying data

// the request target
// where the server is told that we want to access the rest/v2/alpha resource
// the server figures out what to do with it
// if the target is empty -- just a slash -- then we'd be accessing the website's route, restcountries.eu in this example
// request headers, information we send about hte request itself
// many different standard headers: what browser is used to make the request, user's language, and many more
// there is also a request body containing the data we're sending, for example, coming from an HTML form

// HTTPS
// main difference between HTTPS and HTTP is that HTTPS is encrypted
// TLS or SSL are the protocols which are used to encrypt HTTPS
// besides that, the logic behind HTTP requests and responses still applies to HTTPS

// formed request now hits the server, which will work on it until it has our data or web page ready to send back

// HTTP response 
// response message looks similar to request
// has a start line, headers and a body
// HTTP response message format:
// 
// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
// 
// Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2021
// Content-Type: text/html
// Transfer-Encoding: chunked
// 
// <BODY>

// in this example, the start line has, besides the version, a status code and message
// these are used to let the client know whether the request has been successful or failed
// 200 means okay
// 404 means page not found

// TCP/IP
// how request and response data is sent across the web
// TCP and IP are the communication protocols that define how data travels across the web
// TCP
// first job: break requests and responses down into small chunks of data called packets, before they're sent
// second job: once the packets arrive at their final destination, TCP will reassemble all of them back into the original request or response
// this is necessary so that each packet can take a different route through the internet so the message arrives at its destination as quickly as possible
// that wouldn't be possible if the entire request or response were sent as a single big chunk of data
// like trying to get through a traffic jam in the biggest bus imaginable
// IP 
// sends and routes the packets through the internet
// ensures they arrive at the proper destinations using the IP address on each packet

// Asynch JS
// in previous lecture, we did a simple AJAX call to fetch data from a country's API
// we created a function to do that and called it multiple times
// those calls ran in parallel and we couldn't control which one finished first
// in this lecture, we'll create a sequence of AJAX calls so that the second one only runs after the first one has finished
// in the countries data there is a property of bordering countries
// in the case of Portugal, that property is "ESP," for Spain
// so, after the first AJAX call is completed, we will get this bordering country value
// then, based on that code, we'll render the neighboring country right beside the original

const getCountryAndNeighbour = function(country) {

    // AJAX call country 1
    const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`);
    request.send();

    request.addEventListener('load', function(){
        const [data] = JSON.parse(this. responseText);
        console.log(data);

        // Render country 1
        renderCountry(data);

        // Get neighbour country (2)
        const [neighbour] = data.borders;

        // original immediate return solution for countries with no borders property:
        // if (!neighbour) return;

        // AJAX call country 2
        // const request2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
        // request2.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`);
        // request2.send();

        request2.addEventListener('load', function() {
            console.log(this.responseText);

            renderCountry(data2, 'neighbour')
        });

        // searching by code and neighboring country:
        // const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
        // request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/${neighbour}`);
        // request.send();

        // the firing of the second AJAX call happens inside the callback function of the first one
        // inside this callback function, we are adding a new event listener for the new request

        // });
        // };

        // use optional chaining to account for countries with no borders property (island nations, for instance):
        const [neighbour] = data.borders?.[0];
    });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('portugal');

// Callback Hell
// with nested callbacks, doing more such requests in sequence -- the neighbor of the neighbor of the neighbor ten times over -- would be an unmanageable structure
// this happens for all asynchronous tasks, not just AJAX calls
// makes code harder to maintain, difficult to understand and reason through
// code will have more bugs and will be more difficult to add new features and functionality to it
// since ES6, we can escape callback hell via promises


// Promises and Fetch API

// old XML HTTP request function:
// const getCountryData = function (country) {
// const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
// request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country}`);
// request.send();

// Fetch API
const request = fetch(https://restcountries.com/v2/name/${country});  

// for more complex AJAX calls, the fetch function can take in an object of options as well

// What Are Promises?     
// formal definition:
// an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation
// less formal:
// a container for an asynchronously delivered value
// even less formal:
// a container for a future value
// perfect example of a future value is the response coming from an AJAX call
// when we start the AJAX call there is no value yet, but we know there will be a value in the future
// we use the promise to handle this future value

// Lottery Ticket Promise Analogy
// when you buy a lottery ticket, you're buying the promise that you'll receive an amount of moeny in the future if you guess the correct outcome
// you buy the ticket now with the prospect of winning money in the future
// and the lottery draw which determines if you get the money or not happens asynchronously
// you don't have to drop everything else you're doing and wait until the lottery draw happens
// in the event you do get the correct outcome, you will then receive your money because you have your lottery ticket, which is the promise that you bought

// Big Advantage of Using Promises
// 1. no longer need to rely on events and callback functions to handles asynchronous results
// events and callback functions can sometimes cause unpredictable results
// 2. even better, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations instead of nesting like we did before
// and with this, we can finally escape callback hell
// promises are an ES6 feature
// they became available in JS in 2015, so are now widely used by everyone

// Life Cycle of a Promise
// since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time sensitive -- they change over time
// promises can be in different states
// in the beginning, we say that a promise is pending
// this is before any value resulting from the asynchronous talk is available
// during this time, the asynchronous task will be doing its work in the background
// when the task finally finishes, the promise is settled
// two types of settled promises:
// 1. fulfilled promise - a promise that has successfully resulted in a value, just as we expect it
// for example, a promise used to fetch data from an API successfully gets that data with it now being available to use
// 2. rejected promise - means there has been an error during the asynchronous task
// for example, in fetching data from API, the user is offline and can't connect to the API server

// analogy of the lottery ticket
// the lottery draw is the asynchronous task which determines the result
// once the result is available, the ticket is settled
// if we guessed the correct outcome, the lottery ticket will be redeemed and we will get our money
// if didn't guess the correct outcome, the ticket gets rejected and we wasted our money

// these different states are important to understand because, when we use promises in our code, we will be able to handle the different states in order to do something as a result of either a successful promise or a rejected one

// a promise is only settled once -- from then on, that state will remain unchanged forever
// whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected, it's impossible to change that state

// the different states are relevant and useful when we use a promise to get a result
// in other words, we consume a promise

// for a promise to exist, it must first be built
// in case of the fetch API, it's the fetch function that builds the promise and returns it for us to consume
// in this case, we don't have to build the promise ourselves in order to consume it
// most of the time we will just consume promises, which is the easier and more useful part
// sometimes, we'll also need to build a promise


// Consuming Promises

// consume promise returned by the fetch function:

const getCountryData = function(country) {
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then();
};

// calling the fetch function will immediately return a promise
// in the beginning, this promise is still pending because the asynchronous task of getting the data is running in the background
// at a certain point, the promise will be settled in either a fulfilled or a rejected state
// assume the promise will be fulfilled and that we have an available value with which to work
// to handle this fulfilled state, we can use the then method that is available on all promises

const getCountryData = function(country) {
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then(function(response) {

    })
};

// calling the fetch function will immediately return a promise
// in the beginning, this promise is still pending because the asynchronous task of getting the data is running in the background
// at a certain point, the promise will be settled in either a fulfilled or a rejected state
// assume the promise will be fulfilled and that we have an available value with which to work
// to handle this fulfilled state, we can use the then method that is available on all promises
// into the then method, we need to pass a callback function that we want to be executed as soon as the promise is fulfilled -- as soon as the result is available
// this function will receive one argument once it's called by JS -- the resulting value of the fulfilled promise

const getCountryData = function(country) {
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`).then(function(
        response
        ) {
            console.log(response);
            return response.json();
        }).then(function(data) {
            console.log(data);
            renderCountry(data[0];)
        });
};
getCountryData('portugal');

// calling the fetch function will immediately return a promise
// in the beginning, this promise is still pending because the asynchronous task of getting the data is running in the background
// at a certain point, the promise will be settled in either a fulfilled or a rejected state
// assume the promise will be fulfilled and that we have an available value with which to work
// to handle this fulfilled state, we can use the then method that is available on all promises
// into the then method, we need to pass a callback function that we want to be executed as soon as the promise is fulfilled -- as soon as the result is available
// this function will receive one argument once it's called by JS -- the resulting value of the fulfilled promise

// Response
// console log returns object of a type called "Response"
// (contains status code for the headers, among other things)
// the data is in the response body is a ReadableStream, but in order to actually be able to read it, we need to call JSON method on response
// JSON method is available on all the response objects coming from the fetch function, all the resolved values
// problem:
// the JSON function is actually asynchronous itself
// meaning, it will also return a new promise
// confusing, but that's just how it works
// need to return the new promise
// need to handle the new promise by calling a new then
// need another callback function we'll call data
// console.log of data shows that we are back to having the same data as before but this time using two promises
// the resolved value of the promise return response.json() is the data we're looking for itself
// all that's left to do is render country of data zero
// simplifying the code:

const getCountryData = function(country) {
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data) => renderCountry(data[0]));
};
getCountryData('portugal');

// getting rid of the console.logs, we can use arrow functions instead
// this will work because we can now implicitly return the result
// the code becomes more like a readable sentence and therefore more easily understandable
// we're still using callbacks
// promises do not get rid of callbacks, but they do get rid of callback hell


// Chaining Promises
// how to chain promises in order, for instance, to also render the neighboring country of the initial country in the function
// we already have a small chain of promises because of the JSON function: the two .thens that are called in sequence

// chaining together two sequential AJAX calls

const getCountryData = function(country) {
    // Country 1
    fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data) => {
            renderCountry(data[0]);
            const neighbour = data[0].borders[0];

            if(!neighbour) return;

            // Country 2
            return fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/${neighbour}`);
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => renderCountry(data, 'neighbour'));
};
getCountryData('portugal');

// if there is no neighbor, then return immediately
// this isn't going to work, but never mind it for now -- will be dealt with in the error-handling section
// second AJAX call
// need to return the new promise so we'll be able to chain a new then method on the result of the this then (data) method
// the then method always returns a promise, no matter whether we actually return anything or not
// if we do return a value, that value will become the fulfilled value of the return promise
// to demonstrate, instead of:
// return fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/${neighbour}`);
// we instead:
//  return 23;
// });
// .then(data => alert(23));
// and 23 comes up in an alert

// call the JSON method to handle the response
// render country with data
// pass in CSS class for the neighbour
// testing with different countries:
// getCountryData('portugal');
// we get Spain
// getCountryData('germany');
// we get Austria
// promises allow us to handle complex asynchronous operations with as many steps as we want
// we have four steps in the example above, but we can extend that as much as we want
// even if we wanted the neighbor of the neighbor of the neighbor -- 10 countries, say -- we could easily get it by chaining all these promises one after another
// instead of callback hell, we have a flat chain of promises that is very easy to read and understand
// common beginner's mistake is chaining the then method directly onto a new nested promise
// fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/${neighbour}`).then(response => response.json());
// this does work but we are then back in callback hell
// we have one callback function defined inside of another one, exactly what we're trying to avoid


// Handling Rejected Promises
// a rejected promise is one in which an error has happened
// how do we handle such rejected promises?
// the only in which the fetch promise rejects is when the user loses their internet connection
// for now, that will be the only error we will be handling
// we want to simulate that the webpage was loaded but then as the user makes their request without internet connectivity we want to see the error happening

const renderError = function(msg) {
    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentText('beforehand', msg);

// the first callback function is always going to be called for the fulfilled, that is, successful promise
// 2. pass a second callback that will be called when the promise is rejected
// this callback function will be called with an argument which the error itself
// we will simply alert the error
// we handle the error by displaying the alert window
// and, the error we had before, ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED, has disappeared
// in fact, we no longer have it as an Uncaught error because we did catch it right at:
// err => alert(err)
// handling an error is also called catching the error
// in this case, there are no more errors because the chain stops here when the error happens and it's handled
// what if the first fetch promise was fulfilled but the second fetch promise was rejected?
// can insert the error handling function after .then of the second promise, but that gets annoying
// there is a better way of handling all these errors globally in one central place
// instead of having all these callback error functions throughout, delete them
// nicer having one callback in the then and handling all the errors, no matter where they appear in the chain, right at the end of the chain by adding a catch method
// then we can use the same callback function here
// it will also be called with the error object that occurred and then we can handle
// the catch method at the end of the chain will catch any errors that occur in any place in the whole promise chain, no matter where they are
// errors propagate down the chain until they ar caught
// only if they're not caught anywhere do we then get the Uncaught error we saw earlier
// log error to console again using .error for style and using üí•üí•üí• emojis to indicate we printed this
// usually, simply logging the error to the console is not enough in an application with a user interface
// let's also, then, display the error message for the user to see
// so create a renderError function outside and above the code
// use .insertAdjacentText so it doesn't create any new HTML elements
// just as we did in the render countries function, remember that we always have to set the opacity back to 1, because otherwise the container is not going to be visible
// place the render error and render country functions at the top of the file
// use renderError and print the error
// any error in JS that was created with a constructor, just like a map or set, contains the message property
// we can use that to only print the message of that error and not the whole object itself
/ testing by going Offline:
// in the HTML we get the error message:
// Something went wrong üí•üí• Failed to fetch. Try again!
// in the console we get the entire error:
// TypeError: Failed to fetch üí•üí•üí•
// which includes the stack trace showing us exactly where the error comes from

// Finally Method
// add .finally at the end of the function
// the callback function we defined here will always be called, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected
// we use this method for something that needs to happen no matter the outcome of the promise
// one use case is to hide a loading spinner
// these are the rotating color wheels that spin onscreen while a web application is loading data
// the spinner is shown when an asychronous operation starts and is hidden once the operation completes
// it's hidden regardless of whether the operation was successful or not
// in our case, we always need to fade-in the countries container -- that always happens, no matter what
// so we comment-out countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1 in both 
// and place countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1 in the finally method function
// this can only work if catch itself also returns a promise

// searching for a country that doesn't exist
// getCountryData('dsfddsfsdf');
// returns console log:
// TypeError: Cannot read property 'flag' of undefined
// however, this is not reflective of the true error, which is that the API can't find any country with this name
// because this is a 404 error, the fetch promise will still get fulfilled
// there is no rejection so the catch handler cannot pick up on the real error


// Throwing Errors Manually
// because the API couldn't find any country with the entered name during the fetch, there was a request 404 error
// even though there was an obviously big problem with this request, the fetch function did not reject the case
// we will therefore have to do it manually

// checking response object:
// when ok property is set to false, the reason for it is that the status code is 404
// when ok property is set to true, that's because the status code is 200 -- okay
// we can use the fact that the response has the ok property set to false to reject the promise ourselves manually
// we can say, if response.ok is false the we throw a new error and here we can define an error message
// we can also add the status code to display as well
// analysis of what happens here:
// by using the constructor function, we create a new error
// we pass in an error message
// we us the throw keyword which immediately terminates the current function (just like return does)
// the effect of creating and throwing an error in any of these methods is that the promise will immediately reject
// the promise returned by this then handler will be a rejected one
// and that rejection will then propagate all the way down to the catch handler

// why bother handling errors?
// 1. it's the only way we can display an error message on the screen for the user
// 2. really bad practice to leave rejected promises without handling them -- don't do that, always use catch or even finally to handle

// what if there is no error in this promise?
// what if, for example, there is a nonexistent country neighbour entered in the second promise?
// the error isn't handled
// if we copy the previous code into this then handler, we get the error message we want, 400, but then we have a lot of duplicate, repetitive code

// it's a good time to create a nice helper function
// it will wrap up the fetch, the error handling, and also the converstion to JSON
// getJSON
// to make this function truly generic, we do not want to hard code the error message
// instead, we want to pass it in along with response.status
// still need to handle the occasions when a country may have no neighbor -- Australia, for example

///////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
In this challenge you will build a function 'whereAmI' which renders a country ONLY based on GPS coordinates. For that, you will use a second API to geocode coordinates.

Here are your tasks:

PART 1
1. Create a function 'whereAmI' which takes as inputs a latitude value (lat) and a longitude value (lng) (these are GPS coordinates, examples are below).
2. Do 'reverse geocoding' of the provided coordinates. Reverse geocoding means to convert coordinates to a meaningful location, like a city and country name. Use this API to do reverse geocoding: https://geocode.xyz/api.
The AJAX call will be done to a URL with this format: https://geocode.xyz/52.508,13.381?geoit=json. Use the fetch API and promises to get the data. Do NOT use the getJSON function we created, that is cheating üòâ
3. Once you have the data, take a look at it in the console to see all the attributes that you recieved about the provided location. Then, using this data, log a messsage like this to the console: 'You are in Berlin, Germany'
4. Chain a .catch method to the end of the promise chain and log errors to the console
5. This API allows you to make only 3 requests per second. If you reload fast, you will get this error with code 403. This is an error with the request. Remember, fetch() does NOT reject the promise in this case. So create an error to reject the promise yourself, with a meaningful error message.

PART 2
6. Now it's time to use the received data to render a country. So take the relevant attribute from the geocoding API result, and plug it into the countries API that we have been using.
7. Render the country and catch any errors, just like we have done in the last lecture (you can even copy this code, no need to type the same code)

TEST COORDINATES 1: 52.508, 13.381 (Latitude, Longitude)
TEST COORDINATES 2: 19.037, 72.873
TEST COORDINATES 2: -33.933, 18.474

GOOD LUCK üòÄ

// Jonas's Solution

const whereAmI = function(lat, lng) {
    fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json`)
    .then(res => {

};
whereAmI(52.588, 13.381);
// fetch request to the URL
// use a template string because we need to pug in latitude (lat) and, after the comma, longitude (lng)
// call then method and get response (res)
// immediately return res.json()
// which will then return a new promise
// and it is this one which will get us the data, as it's going to be the resolved value of the promise
// testing:
// coordinates return "You are in Berlin, Germany"
// additional test coordinates:
// whereAmI(19.037, 72.873);
// whereAmI(-33.933, 18.474);
// log to console "undefined"
// where API only allows 3 requests per second, we get a 403 error
// the fetch function isn't correctly handling this error -- it isn't rejecting th promise even though this clearly is an error
// we need to do this manually with a return
// two test cases now resolve:
// "You are in Mumbai, India"
// "You are in Cape Town, South Africa"
// reloading very fast gets us uncaught promise
// error message is already the one that we want, but it shouldn't be uncaught
// we need to catch any promise rejection
// error message now reads "Problem with geocoding 403 üí•"
// we could now do something more meaningful with our error handling, like displaying some kind of error message
// or logging this error in an error tracking application
// use this data to render a country


// Asynchronous Behind the Scenes: The Event Loop
// JS Runtime in the Browser Review
// JS runtime is a "container" with all the pieces necessary to execute JS code
// JS Engine
// the heart of every JS runtime is the engine
// it's where, in the call stack, the code is executed
// it's also where, in the heap, objects are stored in memory
// important to note: JS has only one thread of execution -- it can only do one thing at a time, no multitasking
// other languages, Java for instance, can execute multiple pieces of code at the same time, but not JS
// Web APIs environment
// APIs provided to the engine but not part of the JS language itself
// the DOM, timers, the fetch API, the geolocation API, etc.
// Callback Queue
// data structure that holds all the ready to be executed callback functions that are attached to an event that has occurred
// data structure that holds all the ready to be executed callback functions that are attached to an event that has occurred
// whenever the call stack is empty, the event loop takes callback from the callback queue and puts them into the call stack so they can be executed
// the event loop is the essential piece that makes asynchronous behavior possible in JS
// it's the reason we can have a non-blocking concurrency model in JS
// a concurrency model is how a language handles multiple things happening at the same time

// How does this nonblocking concurrency work?
// Why is the event loop so important?
// If the JS engine is built around the idea of single thread, but there's only one thread of execution in the engine, then how can asynchronous code be executed in a non-blocking way?
// start by selecting this image element in the code:
// el = document.querySelector('img');
// in the Call Stack:
// Execution context:
// querySelector()
// in the next line, we set the source attribute of that image to dog.jpg:
// el.src = 'dog.jpg';
// this will now start to load the image asynchronously in the background
// what is this mysterious background?
// everything related to the DOM isn't part of JS but of the web APIs
// a web API environment is where the asynchronous tasks related to the DOM will run
// the same is true for AJAX timers calls and all other asynchronous tasks
// if the image were to load in a synchronous way, it would be doing so right in the call stack and blocking the rest of the code
// JS is asynchronous so that it does not happen in the call stack
// if we want to do something after the image has finished loading then we need to listen to the load event
// so we attach an event listener to the load event of that image and pass in a callback function, as always
// el.addEventListener('load', () => {
//  el.classList.add('fadeIn');
// });
// make an AJAX call using the fetch API:
// fetch('https://someurl.com/api')
//  .then(res => console.log(res));
// as always, asynch fetch operation will happen in the web API's environment
// otherwise, we'd be blocking the call stack and creating a huge lag in our application
// finally, we use the then method on the promise returned by the fetch function
// this will also register a callback in the web API environment so we can react to the future resolved value of the promise
// with this, we've now executed all the top level code -- that is, all the code not inside any callback function -- in a synchronous way
// we have the image loading in the background and some data being fetched from an API
// let's say the image has finished loading and therefore the load event is emitted on that image
// then the callback for this event is put into the callback queue
// callback queue is an ordered list of all the callback functions that are in line to be executed
// it's like a to-do list you would write for yourself with all the taks you have to completed
// in this case, it's a list of the tasks the call stack will have to complete
// if there already were other callbacks waiting in this example, then this new callback would go all the way to the back of the queue, where it would patiently wait for its turn to run
// this has big implications:
// imagine setting a timer for five seconds
// after five seconds, that timer's callback will be put in the callback queue
// if there were already other callbacks waiting and it took one second for all of them to run, the new timer's callback would only run after six seconds rather than five
// this means that the timer's duration that you define, is not a guarantee
// the only guarantee is that the timer's callback won't run before five seconds, but very well might run after five seconds have passed -- it all depends on the state of the callback queue
// important: callback queue also contains callbacks coming from DOM events like clicks and key presses
// DOM events aren't asynchronous behavior, but they still use the callback queue to run their attached callbacks
// if a click happens on a button with an event listener the result will be like the asynchronous load event

// Event Loop
// looks into the call stack and determines whether it's empty or not (except for the global context)
// if the stack is empty -- meaning there's no code being executed -- then it will take the first callback from the callback queue and put it on the call stack to be executed
// this is called an event loop tick
/ the event loop has the critical task of coordinating between the call stack and the callbacks in the queue
// the event loop decides exactly when each callback gets executed
// the event loop orchestrates the entire JS runtime
// from all of this it becomes clear that the JS language itself has no sense of time
// that's because all that is asynchronous does not happen in the enginge
// it's the runtime that manages all the asynchronous behavior
// and the event loop determines which code will be executed next
// while the engine itself simply executes whatever code it is given
// example recap:
// the image started loading asynchrononously in the web API environment and  not in the call stack
// we used addEventListener to attach a callback function to the image load event
// this callback is our asynchronous code -- code we deferred into the future because we only want it to execute once the image has loaded
// in the meantime, the rest of the code keeps running
// the addEventListener did not put the callback directly in the callback queue
// instead, it simply registered the callback which then kept waiting in the web API environment until the load event fired off
// only then did the environment put the callback in the queue
// then, while in the queue, the callback kept waiting for the event loop to pick it up and put it on the call stack
// this happened once the callback was first in line and the call stack was empty
// all this happened so the image would not have to load in the call stack but instead in the background in a non-blocking way
// the web API environment, the callback queue, and the event loop all together make it possible for asynchronous code to be executed in a non-blocking way even wth only one thread of execution in the engine
// we still have the fetch function getting data from the AJAX call in the background
// this is happening by means of a promise
// with promises, things work in a slightly different way:
// let's say the data has finally arrived, so the fetch is done
// callbacks related to promises like the one we registered with the promises then method do not go into the callback queue
// instead, callbacks of promises have a special queue for themselves
// callbacks from promises have a special microtasks queue for themselves
// it has priority over the callback queue
// at the end of an event loop tick, after a callback has been taken from the callback queue, the event loop will check if there are any callbacks in the microtasks queue
// if there are, it will run all of them before it will run any more callbacks from the callback queue
// these callbacks from promises are called microtasks, hence the microtasks queue
// in our example, we have a microtask sitting in the microtasks queue while the call stack is empty
// therefore, the event loop will take the microtask and put it in the call stack just like it does with callbacks from the callback queue
// regardless of whether the callback queue is empty or not, the microtask will always be taken first as microtasks have priority over callbacks
// in practice, microtasks can cut in line before all other regular callbacks
// if one microtask adds a new microtask then the new microtask is also executed before any callbacks from the callback queue are
// if we keep adding more and more microtasks, then callbacks in the callback queue can never execute
// this is never really an occurrence but the possibility exists and may even be a coding interview question


// Event Loop in Practice
// extremely simple example:
console.log('Test start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);
// a timer which should call a timer function exactly after zero seconds
// meaning, after zero seconds, that callback will be put on the callback queue

// next, we'll build a promise that resolves immediately:
Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 1')
	.then(res => console.log(res));
// Promise.resolve() allows us to build a promise that is immediately resolved, one that immediately has a success value
// that fulfilled success value is going to be the one we passed in
// and then we can handle that resolved promise by logging it to the console
// just like any other promise, we can handle it with a then method and the callback function will get called with the resolved value as an argument

// in what order do we think these four messages below will be logged to the console?
console.log('Test start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);
Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 1')
	.then(res => console.log(res));
console.log('Test end');

// the first two messages that will be printed should be obvious because we already know that any top-level code -- code outside of any callback -- will run first
// so of course the first two logs will come from these two synchronous console.logs
// between the timer and the resolved promise it will be a little tricker to figure which will run first
// both will finish at the exact same time, right after zero seconds
// the timer because we told it to finish after zero seconds, and
// the promise because we told it to resolve immediately
// which one will be handled first, that is which of these two callbacks will be executed first?
// the timer appears first in the code and so its callback will be put on the callback queue first
// but that doesn't mean it will be executed first
// because the callback of the resolved promise will be put in the microtasks queue, it will have priority over the callback in the callback queue, executing first
// order in which they will finish:
// Test start, then Test end, then Promise 1, then finally, the timer
// implication of microtasks having priority over regular callback sis that if a microtask takes a long time to run then the regular callback timer will be delayed
// it will run a little bit later, just after the microtask is done with its work
// to simulate that this callback takes a long time to run, loop over a large number with an old school for loop:

console.log('Test start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);
Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 1')
	.then(res => console.log(res));

Promise.resolve('Resolved promise 2').then(res => {
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++){
console.log(res);
})

console.log('Test end');

// to clarify, it isn't the asynchronous task itself that takes a long time -- the promise itself will be resolved immediately -- but the microtask it contains that is put in the microtasks queue, that's what will take a long time
// the zero second timer message appears on the screen after taking a lot of time
// this is proof that the zero seconds timer settings are not a guarantee
// this means you cannot do high precision things using JS timers


// Building a Simple Promise

// lottery simulation using a promise:
// a fulfilled promise means to win the lottery
// a rejected promise means to lose the lottery
// create a new promise using promise constructor
// promises are a special kind of object in JS
// takes exactly one argument which is the executor function
// as soon as the promise constructor runs, it will automatically execute the executor function we pass in
// as it does, it will pass in two other arguments: the resolve and reject functions
// to build the executor function, we will store the result in the variable lotteryPromise
// like the fetch function, which also creates a new promise
// the executor function will contain the asynchronous behavior we're trying to handle with the promise
// so the executor function should eventually produce a result value, the value that going to be the future value of the promise
// very simplified example: we win 50% of cases and lose 50%

const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
        resolve('You WIN ');
    } else {
        reject('You lost your money')
    }
});

// consuming the promise we just built:
// logging the resolved value of the promise
// catching and logging any errors

lotteryPromise.then(res => console.log(res)).catch(err => console.log(err));
// every time this runs, it results in a success (lottery win) or an error (lottery loss)
// to make this example asynchronous, we will add a simple timer set to 2 seconds
// instead of just passing a string in reject, we can create a new error object
// logging results in 'Lottery draw is happening' appearing immediately each time
// 'You WIN ' or 'You lost your money' appear 2 seconds after the lottery draw console loge
// and 'You lost your money' appears as an error message, telling where the error originated

const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

    console.log('Lottery draw is happening');
    setTimeout(function() {
        if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
            resolve('You WIN ');
        } else {
            reject(new Error('You lost your money'));
        }
    }, 2000)
});

// in practice, most of the time all we do is consume promises
// we usually only build promises to wrap old callback-based functions into promises
// this process is called promisifying -- to convert callback-based asynchronous behavior to promises-based
// to see this in action:
// we will promisify a set timeout function and create a wait function
// wait function will take in a number of seconds
// inside it, we will create and return the promise, encapsulating the asynchronous operation even further -- what a fetch function does
// in the case below, we don't need the reject function because it's impossible for the timer to fail, so we'll never have to mark this promise as rejected
// similar to array methods such as map which always receives three arguments even though most of the time we use but one or two of them
// in this case, we're not going to pass any resolved value into the resolve function because that isn't mandatory
// in the case of this timer, it's also not necessary
// in this case, all we want to do is make our code wait
// we want our timer to run for a certain number of seconds so we multiply the value by 1000
// can improve this by making it smaller using arrow functions

// Promisifying setTimeout
const wait = function(seconds) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
    })
}

// calling our wait function:
// this will create a promise that will wait for two seconds and then resolve
// receiving no resolved value in our callback function leaving it empty and simply log to the console
// we could run any code we want executed after two seconds
// but let's wait one more second by returning a new promise here that waits one second
// exactly what we did before when we chained two sequential AJAX calls using the fetch funciton
// the result of the first was that we would create a new fetch and return it -- that's what we're doing here
// all of this returns a new promise that we can then handle
// with this, we now have a nice chain of asynchronous behavior that happens in a sequence without descending into callback hell

wait(2).then(() => {
    console.log('I waited for 2 seconds');
    return wait(1);
})
.then(() => console.log('I waited for 1 second'));

// achieving the same result without using multiple timers in callback hell:

wait(1)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('1 second passed');
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('2 second passed');
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('3 second passed');
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => console.log('4 second passed'));

// setTimeout(() => {
//   console.log('1 second passed');
//   setTimeout(() => {
//     console.log('2 seconds passed');
//     setTimeout(() => {
//       console.log('3 second passed');
//       setTimeout(() => {
//         console.log('4 second passed');
//       }, 1000);
//     }, 1000);
//   }, 1000);
// }, 1000);

// create a fulfilled or rejected promise immediately
// static  method on the promise constructor
// for reject, the .then isn't necessary because there will be no resolved value
// create new error for reject

Promise.resolve('abc').then(x => console.log(x));
Promise.reject(new Error('Problem!')).catch(x => console.error(x));


// Promisifying the Geolocation API

// geolocation API review
// a case of an error could be when the user doesn't allow the page to get access to the current location
// JS asks us for permission and when we allow it, at some point, when JS figures out the location, we get that data back
// this is asynchronous behavior
// the code is not blocked, which we can check with a console log after the geolocation
// 'Getting position' logs first in the console because the function above it offloaded its to the background, to the web API environment of the browser, then immediately moved on the the console log in the next line
// so this is very clearly a callback-based API
// this is another great opportunity to promisify a callback-based API into a promise-based API
// first is the success callback function -- it receives the position
// when we have success, we want to resolve the promise and mark it as fulfilled
// we therefore call the resolve function and pass in that position object because it's the fulfilled value we want to get from the promise when it is successful
// previously, we passed a simple string into resolve for a value
// in this case, the future value of the promise is this much more meaningful object, the value that is the current position
// we do the same with reject, replacing the console log with it
// we can make this even simpler:
// if the function automatically calls the callback functions and passes in the position, we can do the below
// before we specified the callback manually, but all we did was to take the position and pass it down into resolve, which in the simpler version happens automatically
// resolve itself is now the callback function which will get called with the position
// and the same with reject

// navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
//     position => console.log(position),
//     err => console.error(err)
// );
// console.log('Getting position');
// log this position to the console -- don't need the catch block for now

const getPosition = function() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        // navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        //     position => resolve(position),
        //     err => reject(err)
        // );
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
    });
};

// getPosition().then(pos => console.log(pos));
// logs in console:
// GeolocationPosition {coords: GeolocationCoordinates, timestamp: 1598180761035}

// in last coding challenge, we built a function which receives GPS coordinates then renders the corresponding country
// in the original code, we passed in latitude and longitude then reverse geocoded to find the country belonging to those coordinates
// now we get these coordinates via geolocation so we no longer have to pass them into that function
// start by getting the position then doing something with it
// see the latitude and longitude of this coords object
// destructure object and rename latitude and longitude to lat and lng
// chain the next promise, creating a new promise and returning it
// chain the then handler
// error message: latitude is not defined
// in destructuring, the equal sign is for setting a default value, which we're not doing here
// use : instead of = to set value
// now when run, whereAmI identifies the country the user's device is in through geolocation coordinates, then provides data about that country, including displaying its flag
// instead of a callback hell, we have a nice flat chain of promises that is easy to handle and manage
// we can promisify all kinds of asynchronous stuff in JS:
// for example, the old XM HTTP request function we used to make AJAX calls
// the image loading example

// Coding Challenge #2

/* 
Build the image loading functionality that I just showed you on the screen.

Tasks are not super-descriptive this time, so that you can figure out some stuff on your own. Pretend you're working on your own üòâ

PART 1
1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives imgPath as an input. This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the provided image path. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the 'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image ('error' event), reject the promise.

If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution.

PART 2
2. Consume the promise using .then and also add an error handler;
3. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the wait function we created earlier;
4. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display to 'none'), and load a second image (HINT: Use the image element returned by the createImage promise to hide the current image. You will need a global variable for that üòâ);
5. After the second image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds again;
6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image.

TEST DATA: Images in the img folder. Test the error handler by passing a wrong image path. Set the network speed to 'Fast 3G' in the dev tools Network tab, otherwise images load too fast.

GOOD LUCK üòÄ

// me:
const createImage = function(imgPath) {
	document.createElement('.img/img-1.jpg')
        return fetch()
    })

// Jonas:
// create image which will take in an image path
// return a new promise
// resolve and reject functions which are received by our executor function
// create a new image using document.createElement:
// create a new element of the type image ('img')
// set the source property to the image path that is received
// on that image, we can wait for the load event
// append image to DOM element with images class
// resolve the promise with the image element
// we should also listen for the error event
// in this case, we will reject the promise with a new error:
// image not found, because that will be the most likely error

const wait = function(seconds) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
    });
};

const imgContainer = document.querySelector('.images');

const createImage = function(imgPath) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        const img = document.createElement('img');
        img src = imgPath;

        img.addEventListener('load', function() {
            imgContainer.append(img);
            resolve(img);
        });

        img.addEventListener('error', function() {
            reject(new Error('Image not found'));
        })
    });
};

// handle the fulfilled/successful promise
// we received the image as the resolved value
// we don't need to do anything here because the image is already being appended to the DOM
// for now, we can log a message to the console and later worry about waiting the two seconds
// set image path
// add the catch handler to log the error
// pause execution for two seconds using wait function
// return that so we can chain the next then handler to it
// wait doesn't have any resolved value so we don't specify any argument or parameter in this function
// we want to hide the first image
// however, that image is only defined in the first then function and not the second one
// we will need a global variable
// then set current image to the image and current image style display to none
// load second image and wait two seconds
// then hide second image

let currentImg;

createImage('img/img-1.jpg')
.then(img => {
    currentImg = img;
    console.log('Image 1 loaded');
    return wait(2);
})
.then(() => {
    currentImg.style.display = 'none';
    return createImage('img/img-2.jpg');
})
.then(img => {
    currentImg = img;
    console.log('Image 2 loaded');
    return wait(2);
})
.then(() => {
    currentImg.style.display = 'none';
})
.catch(err => console.error(err));


// Consuming Promises with Async/Await
// since ES 2017, there's an even better and easier way to consume promises called async/await
// start by creating a special kind of function, the async function
