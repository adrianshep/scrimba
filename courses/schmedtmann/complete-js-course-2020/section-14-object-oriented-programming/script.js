// What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

// OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects;
// We use objects to model (describe) real-word or abstract features;
// Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block;
// In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code;
// Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another;
// Interactions happen through a public interface (API); methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object;
// OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code").

// Functional Programming is another popular programming paradigm that we will focus on later

// Classes and Instances (Traditional OOP)
// Classes
// like a blueprint from which we can create new objects
// (below is a representation only -- JS does NOT support real classes as represented here)
// User {
//     user
//     password
//     email
// }
// 
// login(password) {
    // Login logic
// }
// 
// sendMessage(str) {
    // Sending logic
// }
